# Pricing-of-vanilla-options-using-the-object-oriented-approach
The objective of this project is to price vanilla options using the object-oriented approach by implementing the Black-Scholes-Merton model
# Methods applied
Pricing European call and put options using Black-Scholes-Merton model
# Steps followed
  1. Setting up class and constructors
  2. Defining and initializing the option parameters: Stock price, Strike price, Interest rate, Dividend yield, Expiry, Volatility
  3. Calculating d1 and d2
  4. Implementing the closed form solution based on the Black-Scholes equation
  5. Plotting the option prices against strike prices
  6. Calculating the option greeks
